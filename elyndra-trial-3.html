    <p class="w3-opacity"><i>-----------------------------------------------------------------</i></p>
    <p class="w3-justify w3-opacity"><i>Before you stands a towering mirror, its surface smooth and cold, stretching far beyond the ordinary. At first glance, it simply reflects your outward appearance... the face and figure you know well.</i></p>
    <p class="w3-justify w3-opacity"><i>But as you peer deeper, the reflection shifts. Behind the familiar image, a faint, shimmering presence begins to emerge... an echo of the self you rarely acknowledge. This reflection is not the one you present to the world, polished and composed, but the hidden self that dwells in the shadows of your mind.</i></p>
    <p class="w3-justify w3-opacity"><i>In this silent glass, you see the parts of you that you hide... even from yourself. The fears you bury, the doubts you push away, and the desires you dare not voice. There lies the weight of your shame, the wounds you try to forget, and the quiet battles fought in solitude.</i></p>
    <p class="w3-justify w3-opacity"><i>And beyond that, there is something moreâ€”an unfamiliar self, strange yet intimate, waiting patiently beneath layers of denial and fear. This self is raw and unguarded, full of untapped potential and forgotten truths.</i></p>
    <p class="w3-justify w3-opacity"><i>The mirror does not judge, it only reveals. It offers a chance to confront what has long been unseen, to recognize the complexity within, and perhaps, to begin the journey toward acceptance and understanding.</i></p>
    <br>
    <p class="w3-justify w3-opacity"><i>You see as your reflections opens their mouth without your command. their voices echoes deep within your soul.</i></p>
    <p class="w3-justify">Look deeper. Beyond the polished mask. Beyond the rehearsed smiles and hardened defenses. There lies the truth of who you are. The pain you've buried. The shame you've carried like a second skin. The dreams you abandoned, piece by piece, to fit into a world that never really saw you.</p>
    <p class="w3-justify">You have spent so long trying to be what others needed you to be, believing that hiding your truth made you stronger. But real strength comes not from suppression, but from integration. From knowing yourself so completely that nothing within you remains in shadow.</p>
    <p class="w3-justify">There is power in your fear. Wisdom in your wounds. Beauty in the messiness you try so hard to erase. Accept it. Accept all of it. You cannot be whole by choosing only the parts of yourself that are easy to love.</p>
    <p class="w3-justify">When you embrace your entirety... light and dark, joy and grief, doubt and desire... you step into your truest form. You begin to live, not as a fractured echo of expectation, but as a being fully alive, fully present.</p>
    <p class="w3-justify">Only then can you become. Only then can your potential unfold... wild, untamed, and utterly yours.</p>
    <br>
    <p class="w3-justify w3-opacity"><i>You take the time to reflect on yourself</i></p>
    <br>
    <p class="w3-justify w3-opacity reveal" style="display: none;"><i>As you begin to accept your true self, your reflection merge into one, the face that you will carry for the rest of your life.</i></p>
    <p class="w3-justify w3-opacity reveal" style="display: none;"><i>For the first time, you are whole.</i></p>
    <p class="w3-justify w3-opacity reveal" style="display: none;"><i>The </i><b>Key</b><i> reveal before you: </i><b>4</b></p>
