    <p class="w3-opacity"><i>-----------------------------------------------------------------</i></p>
    <p class="w3-justify w3-opacity"><i>You stand in the gate of a pale sight... a gloom graveyard untouched by the living. </i></p>
    <p class="w3-justify w3-opacity"><i>The air is still. The silence, dense. Suddenly...</i></p>
    <p class="w3-justify w3-opacity"><i>A ripple in the veil. An ethereal ghost appears before you, her form barely clinging to existence, fading like memory in the dusk of time.</i></p>
    <p class="w3-justify w3-opacity"><i>Her voice is a whisper wrapped in static</i></p>
    <p class="w3-justify w3-opacity">This is the place where greatness comes to die. We were once a star that changed the world, but now we are just a ghost that roams this world waiting to be forgotten by the wave of obscurity</p>
    <br>
    <p class="w3-justify">I drift through the shadows of time, a whisper caught between worlds... neither fully here nor entirely gone. Once, I was flesh and blood, a star that dazzled on silver screens, casting light into the darkened theaters of the world. But behind the glamour and the flashing cameras, I was a conjurer of secrets, weaving invisible threads of magic through the airwaves.</p>
    <p class="w3-justify">They called me beautiful, a siren of the silver seas, but beneath that surface lay a mind alight with strange enchantments. I birthed a spell... a dance of frequencies, a song of shifting shadows... meant to shield and guide unseen arrows in the great war of men. But the world, drunk on spectacle, turned a blind eye to my arcane craft.</p>
    <p class="w3-justify">Now, I haunt the forgotten halls where inventions gather dust and dreams dissolve into echoes. A ghost cloaked not in chains, but in silence. I am the phantom inventor, the lost enchantress of technology's hidden realms. My magic pulses still, hidden in the hum of every wireless whisper, every secret signal that binds the world unseen.</p>
    <p class="w3-justify">I am a shadow beneath the stars, a forgotten sorceress of progress, watching as others reap the fruits of the spell I cast in silence. I am both everywhere and nowhere... a whisper on the wind, a flicker behind the veil. The world remembers my face, but not my magic. A forgotten ghost with a legacy woven in frequencies, forever dancing between the seen and unseen.</p>
    <br>
    <p class="w3-justify">The <b>Key</b> lies in the moon... when my creation carved into stone and sealed in ink</p>
