    <p class="w3-justify w3-opacity"><i>As your vision coalesces, you find yourself within the heart of the Eternal Archive... a labyrinthine library untouched by time. Towering shelves loom like ancient trees, their branches heavy with tomes bound in leather, feather, and memory. Dust dances in the twilight, stirred by a wind that does not belong to this world.</i></p>
    <p class="w3-justify w3-opacity"><i>Then...</i></p>
    <p class="w3-justify w3-opacity"><i>A whisper. Soft as starlight on still water. It finds your ear, not spoken, but remembered.</i></p>
    <p class="w3-justify"><i>All that was, all that is, and all that might yet be… is written here. Some truths are engraved in the songs of the people. Others are buried, lost in the hush of forgotten ages.</i></p>
    <p class="w3-justify"><i>But history does not die... it dreams. And in its dreaming, it yearns to be awakened, to be spoken, to be known. Every tale is a torch. Every memory, a mirror.</i></p>
    <br>
    <p class="w3-justify"><i>In a time long past, after the First Great Conflict shook the foundations of the mortal world, there arose a strange and terrible uprising... one not of man, nor dragon, but of the flightless ones.</i></p>
    <p class="w3-justify"><i>They were called birds, yet they bore no song. Towering, swift, and wild-eyed, they swept across the land not as beasts, but as shadows of judgment. They were many, and their rage was vast. With thunderous strides, they laid waste to the fringes of civilization... farmlands, outposts, and the dreams of settlers.</i></p>
    <p class="w3-justify"><i>The Royal Legions, clad in gleaming armor and armed with fire and steel, were dispatched to silence the rebellion. But the birds... cunning and eldritch... knew the land, and vanished into it like smoke. Arrows missed. Bullets fell upon empty earth. And the wind carried only laughter… or was it war cries?</i></p>
    <br>
    <p class="w3-justify"><i>The <b>Key</b> lies in that sacred date... the moment when the Royal Legions, weary and defeated, withdrew from their first siege against the flightless horde.</i></p>
    <p class="w3-justify"><i>Seek the echoes in the great archive, only then the Key will be granted upon you.</i></p>
